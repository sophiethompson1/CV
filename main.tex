                    American Express Software Engineer Summer Intern 
                    \smallskip

                    In a team of 7 we worked on a microservice in MARS (Modern Accounts Receivable Service), done in \textbf{Java} using \textbf{Spring}. The microservice was testing using \textbf{Chaos Engineering}, we killed services and tested that the services worked as usual. During my time at AmEx we completed 2 sprints, for a sprint I acted as Product Owner within our team. Being Product Owner meant taking on a leader role and monitoring the team's progress and effectiveness

                    In a group of 4 we developed a webapp for prospective university students to compare universities in both social and academic aspects. The webapp was developed through numerous design iterations with multiple stakeholders. The project was written in Python using the Django web framework and some HTML/CSS

                    A compiler for the simplified language WACC. This compiler was written in Java and is capable of translating WACC into ARM assembly code that can then run, giving the desired output ot the program. We expanded the basic compiler to include overloading variables and functions (based on parameters and/or return types).
