                2022-Present & {\textbf{Bloomberg}} \tspace Software Engineer
                    \smallskip

                    After a 3 month induction, I joined the Mobile News \& Alerts team. This team works on the Bloomberg Professional app, both iOS and Android, using \textbf{Swift}, \textbf{Java} and \textbf{Kotlin}. I've also worked on our backend servers which are written in both \textbf{Python} and \textbf{C++}. During my time on the team I have introduced a swipe mechanism, search bar and sorting feature. 

                    \smallskip

                    From the outset I have involved myself in the community, volunteering as a mentor for the BWIT Insight Week and hosting a student for a work experience week.

                    \smallskip

                    During a 5 month placement I worked in the Release Engineering team on an individual project. In \textbf{Python}, using \textbf{Click}, I worked on a command line tool that helps engineers debug and maintain the repository. The purpose of this tool was to reduce the reliance on internal infrastructure so during outages the tool would still be available to the engineers.

                    During my final year project I worked upon existing software, \textbf{COLMAP}, that used the structure from motion algorithm to build a mesh. In this project I developed the software to take advantage of additional available information from the multi view depth data. Where the original program struggled to create even a partial mesh, failing to produce a mesh for the majority. At the end of this project my adapted program succeeded in making full facial meshes for all data subjects.

                2021 & {\textbf{GolfCoach}} \tspace Swift \smallskip

                    In a group of 6 we developed a mobile app for iPhones that would record the user's golf swing and give feedback based on the analysis. We used \textbf{Optical Flow} to track the movement of the golf club and Apple's \textbf{ARKit} to get a 3D skeleton model. The video would playback pausing at key stages of the swing using the skeleton to recognise those positions and give feedback on the speed of motion and the angle of the joints.

                    In a group of 4 we developed a webapp for prospective university students to compare universities in both social and academic aspects. The webapp was mainly \textbf{Python} using \textbf{Django} and some \textbf{HTML}, \textbf{CSS} and \textbf{Javascript}. In the webapp the user gets directed to a quiz based off of this the user is given a shortlist of 5 universities. The webapp was developed through numerous design iterations with multiple stakeholders. In this project we used \textbf{PostgreSQL} for the database and \textbf{Heroku} for deployment.

                    A compiler for the simplified language WACC. This compiler was written in \textbf{Java} and is capable of translating WACC into \textbf{ARM} assembly code that can then run, giving the desired output of the program. We expanded the basic compiler to include overloading variables and functions (based on parameters and/or return types). Optimisations include constant evaluation and control flow.
